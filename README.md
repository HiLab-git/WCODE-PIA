# WCODE-PIA: Partial-instance Annotation

**WCODE-PIA**, that focuses on the learning of incomplete annotations, is a medical image segmentation framework improved from [**WCODE**](https://github.com/WltyBY/WCODE).

* This project focuses on the incomplete labeling task, in which the foreground area is partially labeled and the remaining pixels are considered as the background.
